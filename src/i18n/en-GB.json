You can use triple backticks <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code> to mark code blocks\n\n```\nThis will be monospaced\n```\n\nTo be interpreted correctly, the three backticks need to be at the start of the line and immediately followed by a line-break.\n\nBe aware that any preceding paragraph content should be properly terminated with a double line break, too. So, this example is wrong:\n\n<pre>\nThis is an ordinary paragraph\n&#96;&#96;&#96;\nThis will be monospaced\n&#96;&#96;&#96;\n</pre>\n\nThe correct version is:\n\n<pre>\nThis is an ordinary paragraph\n\n&#96;&#96;&#96;\nThis will be monospaced\n&#96;&#96;&#96;\n</pre>\n\nNote that some keyboard layouts treat the backtick as a [[dead key|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key]], making it hard to type. The trick is to type three backticks followed by a space. Alternatively, type all six backticks in one go, then a space, and then move the cursor back three characters to type or paste the content.\n\n"
